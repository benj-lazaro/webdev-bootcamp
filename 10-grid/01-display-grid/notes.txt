CSS Grid Notes
==============
- A two-dimensional layout system

- Grid is 'declared' within the 'container'
    - Often a <div> element with a class of 'container'
    - Target the '.container' in CSS

Example:

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: <col1>fr <col2>fr ... ;  /* number and size of columns */
    grid-template-rows: <row1>fr <row2>fr ...;      /* number and size of rows */
    gap: <value>px;                                 /* gap size between grid items */
}


- Default behavior for Grid container:
    - It tries to take up the full width (need to adjust the 'width' property)
    - Only have as much height as it allows to fit the content (does NOT need to change the 'height' property)
