CSS Grid Notes
--------------
- It is a 2-dimensional layout system.

- A grid is declared within a container.
    - Often a <div> element with a class of 'container'
    - Define the styling of the .container in CSS

- The grid container default behavior:
    - It tries to take up the full width; can be adjusted with the 'width' property
    - It only have as much height as it allows the content to fit (no need to tinker the 'height' property)


Example
--------
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: <col1>fr <col2>fr ... ;  /* number and size of columns */
    grid-template-rows: <row1>fr <row2>fr ...;      /* number and size of rows */
    gap: <value>px;                                 /* gap size between grid items */
}
