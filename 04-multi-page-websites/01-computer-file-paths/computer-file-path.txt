Computer File Path
------------------
- A file path can direct someone (user or computer) to a file or folder
    - It looks into a specified location (i.e. folder) within a computer's hard drive
    - In order to access a specific file


- The "root" is the starting point of the computer's filing system
    - It is usually referred to as your computer's hard drive
        - On Windows OS = drive C:
        - On Mac OS     = Macintosh HD
        - On Linux OS   = /


- Two types of file path
    - Absolute  = a file path that is relative to the computer's root folder
    - Relative  = a file path that is relative to the location where you are writing code (e.g. index.html)


- Special characters that help in writing relative file paths
    - '..'  = go up a level from the current folder & then look for the targeted file
    - './'  = stay within the current folder & look for the targeted file
