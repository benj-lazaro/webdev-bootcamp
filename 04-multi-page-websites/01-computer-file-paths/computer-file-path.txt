Computer File Path
------------------
- A file path can direct someone (user or computer)
    - To look into a specific location (folder) in the computer's hard drive
    - To access a specific file


- The root is the starting point of the computer's filing system


- Two types of file paths
    - Absolute  = relative to the computer's root folder
    - Relative  = relative to the location of the current folder being accessed


- Navigation special characters
    - '..'  = go up a level from the current folder
    - './'  = stay within the current folder & search for the targeted file
