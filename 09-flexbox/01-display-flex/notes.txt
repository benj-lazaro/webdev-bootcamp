How to use Flexbox
-------------------
- Flexbox is 'declared' within the 'container'
    - Often a <div> element with a class of 'container'
    - Target the '.container' in CSS

Example:

.container {
    display: flex;      /* Override other 'display' values e.g. block, inline, block-inline & none */
    gap: 10px;          /* Space in-between items enclosed within the '.container' */
    ...
}

- Flexbox items w/in the Flexbox container
    - Ignore their default 'display' property and set them to 'inline'
    - Width of each item will be based on the size of their content

- Flexbox property 'gap' provides the space in-between items w/in the container
    - The value is expressed as em or px

- By default, a Flexbox container has a 'display' property set to 'block'
    - It consumes the entire row with a 'width' set to '100%'

- A Flexbox container's 'display' property can be assigned with a value of 'inline-flex'
    - It behaves similarly to 'inline-block'
    - It allows a Flexbox container to occupy as much as it needs
    - It allows other elements after the container to occupy the remaining space on the same row
