Flexbox
=======
- 'float' is good for magazine style layouts
    - Good for wrapping text around an image
    - DO NOT use for web design layouts

- Flexbox handles the overall page structure


To use Flexbox
--------------
- Flexbox is 'declared' within the 'container'
    - Often a <div> element with a class of 'container'
    - Target the '.container' in CSS

Example:

.container {
    display: flex;      /* Override other 'display' values e.g. block, inline, block-inline & none */
    gap: 10px;          /* Space in-between items enclosed within the '.container' */
    ...
}

- Using Flexbox and enclosed elements within a flexbox '.container':
    - Their default 'display' property will be ignored & set to 'inline'
    - Their 'width' property will be based on the size of their content
    - The 'gap' property provides space in-between elements; expressed as px or rem

- By default, a Flexbox container functions has a 'display' property with a value of 'block'
    - It consumes a 'width' of '100%'

- Another way is to create a Flexbox container by assigning 'display' property with a value of 'inline-flex'
    - Functions similarly to the 'display' property with the value of 'inline-block'
    - Allows the container to occupy as much space it needs 
    - BUT allows other elements to occupy the remaining available space of the same row
