Flex Direction
==============

- By default, Flexbox has a 'flex-direction' property with a value set to 'row'
    - Visualize each item within a Flexbox container stacked-up side-by-side on the same row
    - The 'row' where items are placed is referred to as the 'main-axis'
    - Item are placed from left to right on the same row (or horizontal plane)
    
    - The 'cross-axis' remain perpendicular to the 'main-axis'
    - Where it orients items within a Flexbox container from top-to-bottom


- If the 'flex-direction' is set to 'column'
    - Items within the container is stacked up together from top-to-bottom on the same column
    - The 'column' where the items are placed is referred to as the 'main-axis'
    - Items are placed from top to bottom on the same column (or vertical plane)

    - The 'cross-axis' remains perpendicular to the 'main-axis' (this time  on the horizontal plane)
    - Where it orients items within a Flexbox container from left-to-right


- The Flexbox property 'flex-basis'
    - This property can ONLY be set on the CHILDREN within a Flexbox container

    - If the 'flex-direction' is set to 'row'
        - The 'flex-basis' property sets the width of each item w/in a Flexbox container
        - It flexes each item w/in the container along the main-axis (horizontal plane)

    - If the 'flex-direction' is set to 'column'
        - The 'flex-basis' property sets the height of each item w/in a Flexbox container 
        - It flexes each item w/in the container along the main-axis (vertical plane)
