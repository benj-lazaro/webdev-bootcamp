---------------------------------
- #1: Watch the video within 10 mins. mark

    - After the 10 mins. mark
        - Launch VS Code 
        - Replicate what is taught

    - Understand why the code worked
        - Test if the material is fully understood


- #2: Take notes
    - Use a note taking system e.g. 'Cornell Notes'
