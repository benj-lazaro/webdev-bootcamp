How to get help when stuck
--------------------------
- Evaluate: Expectation VS Reality
    - What did you expect your code to do VS What actually happened
    - Try to figure out what is causing the difference


- Encountering rrror messages
    - Copy the error message
    - Paste it on Google to figure out what it means
    - Check answers from the Stack Overflow website (https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - This is part of the developer workflow


- Re-watch
    - Re-watch some of the videos up to the point when the code started breaking
    - In the videos, there are step-by-step instructions
    - Check for typos in the code


- Check the code
    - Compare your code to the instructor's code
    - At the end of each module, attached is a downloadable completed code
    - Compare and check for typos or mistakes in your code


- Udemy's Q & A section
    - Last resort after exhausting all of the aforementioned tips 
    - Post the question to the corresponding tutorial module where you're having an issue
    - Post the question using the 4-step approach
        1. What did you expect
        2. What actually happened
        3. Include a screenshot of your code that corresponds to the problem
        4. Include a screenshot of the debug console that includes any errors
