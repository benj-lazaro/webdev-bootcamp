How to make most of your time
-----------------------------

Tip #1:
- Watch the video tutorials within the 10 minute mark

- Try to understand what is going on
    - Why the code is being written
    - Understand the purpose of the code
    - Do NOT type or code along at the same pace

- Once you've understood what those 10 minutes are about
    - What the tutorial is trying to teach you

- Then go to VS Code
    - Type out the code
    - Try to replicate what happened in the 10 minutes

- Why this works:
    - This forces you to really understand what's going on
    - Absorb the content
    - Then test yourself afterwards to see if you really understood 


Tip #2:
- While listening to the videos, understanding what's going on
    - Take notes for yourself
    - Quite useful after the 10 minutes are up
    - Trying to remember the code and theory that was covered
    - Use a note-taking system such as Cornell Notes


Tip #3:
- Do NOT skip any of the tutorials on any of the modules
    - The curriculum is designed so that it would be a smooth sloping ramp


Tip #4:
- Boormark topics that you struggle with
    - Use Tip #1 to go through the material again
    - Research on the topic on other sourcees
    - If that does NOT work, try to come back to it after a week


Tip #5:
- Persevere and continue to put in the hours to practice, to try and try again
    - To master a skill, the most important thing is PRACTICE
    - Watching a video = learning superficially


Tip #6:
- Getting stuck is very much a universal part of programming
    - Use Google and Stack Overflow
    - Struggle is Good
