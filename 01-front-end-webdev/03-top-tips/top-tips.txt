How to make most of your time
-----------------------------
- Tip #1: Watch the vide tutorials within the 10 minute mark
    - Try to understand what is going on
        - Why the code is being written
        - Understand the purpose of the code
        - Do NOT code along at the same pace

    - Once you've understood what those 10 minutes are about
        - Figure out what the tutorial is trying to teach you

    - Then open VS Code
        - Type the code
        - Try to replicate what was taught within the 10 minute mark
    
    - Understand why it worked
        - This method forces to really understand what is going on
        - It helps absorb the content
        - Test yourself afterwards to check if you really understood the material


- Tip #2: While listening to the video, understand what is going on
    - Take notes using a note-taking system such as "Cornell Notes"
        - After the 10 minute mark is up

    - Try to remember the theory and then the code that was covered


- Tip #3: Do NOT skip any of the tutorials on any of the modules
    - The curriculum is designed so that it be a smooth sloping ramp


- Tip #4: Boormark topics that you struggle with
    - Use Tip #1 to go through the material once again
    - Research more on the topic on other sourcees
        - If this does NOT work
        - Come back to it after a week


- Tip #5: Persevere & continue to put in the hours to practice (try & try again)
    - To mater a skill
        - The MOST import thing is PRACTICE
    
    - Watching the video is learning SUPERFICIALLY


- Tip #6: Getting stuck is very much a universal part of programming
