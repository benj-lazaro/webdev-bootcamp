How To Get Help When You're Stuck
---------------------------------
- Evaluate: Expectation VS Reality
    - Expected the code to perform VS what actually happened 
    - Try to figure the what went wrong


- When encountering an error message
    - Copy the exact error message
        - Paste it on preferred search engine

    - Look for solutions from Stack Overflow
        - This is part of the developer workflow
        - Website ((https://stackoverflow.com/))


- Re-watch the video within the 10 mins.
    - Until the part when the code started to break
    - Check for typos in the code


- Compare the written code to the instructor's code
    - Each module has an attached (downloadable) complete code
    - Download and look for typos or mistakes in your code


- Use Udemy's Q & A section
    - The LAST RESORT after exhausting previous tips

    - Post the question to the corresponding course module
    
    - Use the 4-steps approach in posting a question
        1. What did you expect to happen
        2. What actually happened
        3. Include a screenshot of your code that corresponds to the problem
        4. Include a screenshot of the debug console that includes any errors
