CSS Float
=========
- NOTE: It is recommended to use 'float' only to wrap text content around images
- For complex layouts (and in modern web design), use CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid or Bootstrap instead


float: left
-----------
- An element (often an image) enclosed within a parent with a 'block-inline' display
- Moves the element to 'float' to the left-hand side of its neighboring element
- Effectively placing the neighboring element on the right-hand of the targeted element (e.g. image)


Syntax:

selector {
    float: left;
}


float: right
------------
- An element (often an image) enclosed within a parent with a 'block-inline' display
- Moves the element to 'float' to the right-hand side of its neighboring element
- Effectively placing the neighboring element on the left-hand of the targeted element (e.g. image)


Syntax:

selector {
    float: right;
}


clear: <left | right | both>
----------------------------
- Clears the responsibility of an element to wrap-around (float) to its neighboring element
- This for an element preceeded with a neighboring element assigned with a 'float' property
