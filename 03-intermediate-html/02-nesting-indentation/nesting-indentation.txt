Nesting And Indentation
-----------------------
- When working with nested lists in a HTML document
    - It is best that the lists and corresponding items are indented

    - Allows the HTML code to be readable

    - NOTE: VS Code "Prettier" automatically indents
        - The list and its corresponding items
