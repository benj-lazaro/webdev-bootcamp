Image Element
-------------
- The self-closing HTML element <img> embeds an image into a HTML document
    - It requires the HTML attribute "src" to work
        - It contains the path to the image file

    - The HTML attribute "alt"
        - Serves as a text replacement for the image 
            - In the event that the image can NOT be loaded for some reason

        - This is MANDATORY for accessibility
