-------------
- The self-closing element <img> allows
    - To embed an image in an HTML document

    - The HTML attribute "src"
        - Refers to the path where the image file is located


    - The HTML attribute "alt"
        - Serves as a text replacement for the image
        - In the event that the image can NOT be rendered or loaded
        
        - NOTE: This is MANDATORY for accessibility

        src="/media/cc0-images/grapefruit-slice-332-332.jpg"
