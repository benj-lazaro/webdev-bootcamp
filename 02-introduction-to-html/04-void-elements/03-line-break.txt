Line Break Element
------------------
- The HTML element <br> produces a line break in text (carriage-return)
    - It is a void element

    - It is best used for breaking down content within a single HTML element <p>
        - Into several lines
        - e.g. home address, poem, etc.

    - NOTE: Do NOT use it as a replacement for the HTML element <p>
        - This is NOT good for accessibility
        
        - It makes it harder for blind users using screen readers to understand the HTML document's content
