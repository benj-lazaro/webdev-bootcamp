Heading Element Purpose
-----------------------
- The purpose of heading elements is to convey a level of importance
    - This idea came from traditional book binding


- The HTML elements <h1> to <h6> represents the six (6) level of section headings
    - It is a block-level element
        - It starts on a new line
        - It takes up the full width available in their containing block

    - Reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)


- Important rules for convention
    - Avoid using multiple <h1> elements on one page
        - Limit only to one <h1> element per HTML document (i.e. web page)

    - Avoid skilling a heading level
        - Go through each heading level


Example:

<h1>Papa's Pizza</h1>
<h2>The best pizza in the multiverse</h2>
