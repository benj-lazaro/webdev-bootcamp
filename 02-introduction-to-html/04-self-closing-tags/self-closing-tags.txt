Void Elements
-------------
- These elements are forbidden from putting content inside the HTML tag

- Theese are often used with self-closing HTML tags such as:
    - Break             = <b /> or <br>
    - Horizontal Rule   = <hr /> or <hr>

- NOTE: Do NOT use <br /> to ADD A NEW LINE instead of creating a separate <p> element
    - This is NOT good for accessibility
    - This makes it harder for blind users with screen readers to understand the content of the website

    - Use the <br /> element ONLY when there is some sort of reason
        - To break a content into several lines in a single paragraph (e.g. home address, poem)
