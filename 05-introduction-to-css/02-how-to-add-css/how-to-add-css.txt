How To Add CSS
--------------
Three (3) ways of adding CSS into an HTML document:

Inline
------
- Styles that are declared within the opening of an HTML tag
    - Uses the global attribute "style"
    - Assigned with a CSS "property: value" pair 

    <h1 style="color: blue">Style Me in Blue!</h1>

    - Defined CSS style is implemented ONLY on the specific HTML tag
        - It used for TESTING PURPOSES only
        - Primarily for troubleshooting CSS styling-related issues (e.g. color, font, etc.)

    - IMPORTANT: It has the HIGHEST ORDER of SPECIFICITY 
    

Internal
--------
- Styles that are declared using the <style> tag
    - Located within the <head> element

    - The CSS code is written within the pair of <style> .. </style> element

    - The targeted HTML element, CSS property & corresponding value
        - Are declared within the <style> tag

    <head>
        ..
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    - Defined CSS style is/are implemented on targeted HTML element(s) within a HTML document
        - This approach is NOT APPLICABLE for a multi-paged website


External
--------
- Styles that are declared using the <link> element
    - Located within the <head> element

    - The HTML attribute "rel" defines the role of the file
        - Assigned with the value of "stylesheet"
        - This meant that the file is a stylesheet file

    - The HTML attribute "href" defines the location of the external CSS file
        - The external .css file contains
            - Targeted HTML elements
            - CSS properties and corresponding values

    <head>
        ..
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    </head>

    - This is the commonly used method of attaching CSS to an HTML document
    
    - Defined CSS styles are implement on targeted HTML element(s) on ALL HTML documents
        - Provided that an HTML document is CONNECTED to the corresponding external CSS file
