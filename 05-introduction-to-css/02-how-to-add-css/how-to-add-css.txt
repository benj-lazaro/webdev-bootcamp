How To Add CSS
--------------
- Three (3) ways of adding a style sheet in an HTML document
    - Inline CSS
        - Refers to the styling that are declared
            - Within a starting HTML tag
            - Uses the HTML attribute "style"
            - Assigned with by a CSS "<property> : <value>" pair

        - Styling ONLY APPLIES to the specified targeted HTML element
            - NOT RECOMMENDED for styling HTML elements
            - Intended for testing purposes ONLY

        - NOTE: This has the HIGHEST order of SPECIFICITY


    - Internal CSS
        - Refers to the styling that are declared
            - Using the HTML element <style>..</style>
            
        - Within the HTML element <style> defines the
            - CSS Selector (i.e. targeted HTML element)

            - It's corresponding CSS "<property> : <value>" that
                - Defines the style to be implemented on the selector

        - Styling APPLIES to ALL targeted HTML elements W/IN a web page
            - NOT APPLICABLE to a multi-page web site


    - External CSS
        - Refers to the styling that are declared
            - Using the self-closing HTML element <link>
                - A child element of the HTML element <head>..</head>

                - Uses the HTML attribute "rel"
                    - To define the "role" of the file (i.e. stylesheet)

                - Uses the HTML attribute "src"
                    - To assign the location of the external ".css" file

        - The external ".css" file contains the declaration of
            - CSS Selector (i.e. targeted HTML element)

            - It's corresponding CSS "<property> : <value>" that
                - Defines the style to be implemented on the selector

        - Styling APPLIES to ALL targeted HTML elements on 
            - EVERY HTML document of a multi-paged web site

            - PROVIDED that each HTML document contains a "link"
                - To the external ".css" file


Example:

/* Inline CSS */
<h1 style="color: blue">Style Me in Blue!</h1>


/* Internal CSS */
<style>
    h1 {
        color: red;
    }
</style>


/* External CSS */
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
</head>
