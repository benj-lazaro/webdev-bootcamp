How To Add CSS
--------------
Three ways of adding CSS into an HTML website
- Inline
    - Declared at the opening tag of a targeted HTML element 
    - Using the global attribute 'style'
        - Assigned with the CSS code
            - Property
            - Value

        <h1 style="color: blue">Style Me in Blue!</h1>
    
    - Styles are applied to a single HTML element
        - Useful for adding CSS style to just a single element in a HTML document
            - However doing so it quite cubersome & repetitive
            - It can be used for testing 

    - NOTE: This has the HIGHEST ORDER in terms of CSS specificity
 

- Internal
    - Declared using the <style> element
        - Located within the <head> element
        - CSS code is written within the <style>..</style> element
            - Defines the selector (target HTML element) 
            - Followed by a pair of { }
                - Containing in-between the element's property & corresponding value

        <head>
            ..
            <style>
                h1 {
                    color: red;
                }
            </style>
        </head>

    - Styles are applied anywhere within the same (only one) HTML document
        - It can target & set stlyes of multiple HTML elements
        - It is NOT applicable to a website with multiple HTML documents


- External
    - Declared using the element <link> located within the <head> element
        - Attribute 'rel' defines the 'role' of the file
            - Assigned with the value of 'stylesheet'

        - Attribute 'href' points to a separate CSS file
            - Where the selector, corresponding properties & values are defined

        <head>
            ..
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
        </head>

    - This is the style most commonly used in web development
        - Styles are implemented on all HTML documents
        - As long as it includes the <link> element pointing to the external CSS file
