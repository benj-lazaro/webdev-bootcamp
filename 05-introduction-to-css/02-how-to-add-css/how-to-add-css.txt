How To Add CSS
--------------
Three ways of adding CSS into an HTML document

Inline
------
- Declared at the opening of an HTML tag
    - Using the global attribute 'style'
    - Assigned with a CSS property and value

    <h1 style="color: blue">Style Me in Blue!</h1>

    - CSS styles are applied ONLY to a single HTML element / tag
        - Often used for TESTING purposes only
        - Troubleshooting styling-related issues (e.g. color, font-size, font-family, etc.)

    - NOTE: This has the HIGHEST ORDER of CSS Specificity 


Internal
--------
- Declared using the <style> element
    - Located within the <head> element

    - CSS code is written within the pair of <style> .. </style> element

    - Within, it declares the targeted HTML element (CSS Selector)
        - Followed by a pair of { }
        - Within, the CSS property to be styled and it's corresponding value

    <head>
        ..
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    - Internal CSS styles are applied to the targeted HTML element within the HTML document
    - This approach is NOT applicable to websites with multiple HTML documents


External
--------
- Declared using the <link> element
    - Located within the <head> element

    - The HTML attribute 'rel' defines the role of the file
        - Assigned with the value of 'stylesheet'
        - This means that the corresponding file is a stylesheet file

    - The HTML attribute 'href' defines the location of the external CSS file
        - The file contains the targeted CSS Selectors
            - Their corresponding CSS properties and assigned values

    <head>
        ..
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    </head>

    - This is the commonly used method of attaching CSS to an HTML document
    
    - CSS styles are implement on all HTML documents
        - Provide that the HTML document is connected to the corresponding external CSS file
