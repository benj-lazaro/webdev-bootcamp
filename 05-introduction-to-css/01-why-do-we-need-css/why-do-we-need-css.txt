Why Do We Need CSS
------------------
- CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets"
    - It conjures an image of a waterfall cascade
    - Wherein water at one level drops (cascades) down into another level


- The styles defined cascades like a waterfall
    - Begins with the MOST GENERAL down to the MOST SPECIFIC styling requirements


- The 'style sheet' part of CSS refers to the type of language
    - It specifies HOW an element SHOULD LOOK in a website 

    - The most IMPORTANT STYLE SHEET to learn is CSS
        - Alternative style sheets
            - SASS  = Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet
            - LESS  = LEaner Style Sheet


- W3C consortium released HTML vesion 3.1 in 1997
    - Introduced new HTML elements (tag) and attributes
        - <font>            = Allows to define the font size, color & font face
        - <center>          = Centers the text element
        - attribute 'color'
        - attribute 'face'
        - attribute 'size'

        - NOTE: These are now DEPRECATED


- In 1996, W3C proposed a new recommendation
    - Led by Hakon Wium Lie (Father of CSS)
    - Allows to attach styles into HTML documents (Inline CSS)
        - e.g. colors, fonts & spacing
