Why Do We Need CSS
------------------
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
    - Conjures an image of a waterfall cascade
        - Water at one level drops down through a waterfall into another level
    
- Styles in CSS cascades like a waterfall
    - It starts at the most general down to the most specific styling requirements

- The 'style sheet' part of CSS
    - Refers to the type of language
    - That specifies who things (elements) should look in a website

    - The most important style sheet to learn is CSS
        - Other style sheets available out there include 
            - SASS  = Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet
            - LESS  = Leaner Style Sheet

- W3C Consortium released HTML 3.2
    - Came out in 1997
    - Introduced new HTML tags & attributes
        - <font>            = Allows to define the font size, color & font face
        - <center>          = Centers the text element
        - 'color' attribute
        - 'face' attribute
        - 'size' attribute

        - NOTE: These attributes & tags are now DEPRECATED

- W3C proposed a new recommendation in 1996
    - Led by Hakon Wium Lie (Father of CSS)
    - To allow to attach styles (e.g. colors, fonts & spacing) to HTML documents

- CSS Demo (https://appbrewery.github.io/just-add-css/)
    - Toggles between a plain HTML website and a CSS enabled one
