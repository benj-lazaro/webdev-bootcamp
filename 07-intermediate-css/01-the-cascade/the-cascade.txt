The Cascade: Specificity & Inheritance
--------------------------------------
- The "cascading" part of CSS is relevant to the
    - Multiple different and conflicting CSS rules that
        - Targets the same HTML Element 

    - It determines which CSS rule is higher up in the hierarchy

    - Identifies w/c CSS rule gets applied & w/c gets ignored
        - This refers to the "order of importance"

    - Multiple styles can be applied to the same HTML Element
        - The CSS rule with the higest "order of importance"
        - Gets to apply its style rendered on the targeted element

    - This is how the "cascade" in CSS comes to be


- There are four (4) broad categories that 
    - Determines the overall "order of importance" of a CSS rule

    - 1. Postion (Lowest Order)
        - Refers to the order of importance based on
            - The position of a CSS rule relative to other rules w/in a CSS Selector
        
            - The lower positioned (last one declared) CSS rule
                - Override its predecessor 
                - Get to be rendered on the browser

        - Same applies to CSS Selectors with identical CSS rules
            - A CSS Selector declared at the power part of the a CSS stylesheet
                - Override its predecessor
                - Get its identical CSS rule(s) to be rendered on the browser

        - NOTE: The lower in the position within a stylesheet
            - The MORE IMPORTANT it (i.e. CSS rule) is


    - 2. Specificity
        - Refers to how specific a CSS Selector is
            - In terms of the elements that the CSS rule(s) is being applied to

        - Element Selector
            - It is the LEAST SPECIFIC

        - Class Selector (.i.e .<class_nam>)
            - It is higher than the Element Selector
            - It is lower than the Attribute Selector

        - Attribute Selector (i.e. <element>[<attribute>])
            - It is higher than the Class Selector
            - It is lower than the ID Selector

        - ID Selector (i.e. #<id_name>)
            - It is the MOST SPECIFIC
            - It overrides the rest of the CSS Selector types


    - 3. Type
        - Refers to the how a CSS stylesheet is 
            - Applied or implemented to an HTML document

        - External CSS
            - It has the LEAST level of importance
            - It can be overriden by an Internal or Inline CSS

        - Internal CSS
            - It has a higher level of importance over an External CSS
            - It can be overriden by an Inline CSS

        - Inline CSS
            - It has the highest order of importance


    - 4. Importance (Highest Order)
        - Refers to the use of the keyword "!important"
            - Placed besides a CSS rule
            - It DISREGARDS previously define CSS rules

        - NOTE: It can be OVERRIDEN with Specificity
