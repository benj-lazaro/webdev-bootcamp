Ways To Combine CSS Selectors
=============================

Group
-----
- Use a ',' in-between a group of CSS selectors
- Defined rule(s) applies to the specified CSS selectors

Syntax:

selector, selector {
    property: value;
}


Child / Direct Child
--------------------
- Use a '>' in-between CSS selectors
- Left-hand side of '>' = Parent CSS selector
- Right-hand side of '>' = direct (1 level-nested down) Child CSS selector
- Defined rule(s) applies to the direct child CSS selector

Syntax:

selector > selector {
    property: value;
}


Descendant
----------
- Use a ' '  in-between CSS selectors
- Left-hand side of ' ' = Parent CSS selector
- Right-hand side of ' ' = Descendant CSS selector
- Defined rule(s) applies to ALL descendants of the parent CSS selector

Syntax:

selector selector {
    property: value;
}


Chaining
--------
- Chain CSS selectors together; NO space in-between selectors
- Often the Element selector is typed first followed by other CSS selectors
- Target VERY SPECIFIC elements
- Defined rule(s) applies to ALL selectors that are True

Syntax:

selectorselector {
    property: value;
}


Combining Combiners
-------------------
- Combining other CSS combiners together
- Often used to target an ancestor selector and a descendant selector defined with combined selectors

Syntax:

selector selectorselector {
    property: value;
}
