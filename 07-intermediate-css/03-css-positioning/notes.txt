CSS Positioning
===============
- Demo (https://appbrewery.github.io/css-positioning/)

Static
------
- HTML default flow
- Each item in a web page would be arranged (flow) as they're written in HTML code
- NO need to define the CSS rule 'position: static' as it is applied by default
- It goes to the bottom of the previous element

Syntax:

selector {
    positon: static;
    left: <value>px;
    top: <value>px;
}


Relative
--------
- Positions an item that is relative to it's default (or static) position
- It is "pushed" relatively using the defined left & top positions

Syntax:

selector {
    positon: relative;
    left: <value>px;
    top: <value>px;
}


Absolute
--------
- Positions an item relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
    - Ancestor element has with CSS rule of 'position: relative'
- Positions an item to the top-left corner of the web page if it DOES NOT have a positioned ancestor

- The 'z-index' determines which element goes on top of another element in the z-axis
    - Element with a higher z-index value goes on top
    - All elements have a default z-index  value of 0

- Setting an element with a position of 'absolute' remove the element from the HTML default flow
    - Place the element on a different layer
    - This affects the z-index of the element

Syntax:

selector {
    positon: relative;
    left: <value>px;
    top: <value>px;
}

selector {
    z-index: <value>;
}


Fixed
-----
- Positions an item relative to the top left-corner of the browser window (NOT the web page)
- The item's position is fixed and will NOT move even when scrolling (up/down) the web page
